What is Alpine Linux?

Alpine Linux is a Linux distribution built around musl libc and BusyBox.
The Alpine base image is only 5 MB in size and has access to a package repository that is much more complete than other BusyBox based images.
This makes Alpine Linux a great image base for utilities and even production applications.
